We have solved problems (1) and (3).\n\ndef make_palindromes(names):\n    names_backwards = list()\n    \n    for name in names:\n        names_backwards.append(name + name[::-1])\n    \n    return names_backwards\n\n\np_name = make_palindromes(names)\n\n\nfor p in p_name:\n    print(p.upper())\n\nMILADDALIM\nRODOLFOOFLODOR\nTIFFANYYNAFFIT\nKHALADDALAHK\nJEFFFFEJ\nCHRISTELLETSIRHC\nFIRASSARIF\n\n\n\nAbove: this is even better. We have now also solved problem (2), because you can call the function with any list, not just names.\nFor example, what if we had multiple lists:\n\n\nnames1 = [\"milad\", \"rodolfo\", \"tiffany\"]\nnames2 = [\"Trudeau\", \"Scheer\", \"Singh\", \"Blanchet\", \"May\"]\nnames3 = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\"]\n\n\nnames_backwards_1 = list()\n\nfor name in names1:\n    names_backwards_1.append(name + name[::-1])\n    \nnames_backwards_1\n\n['miladdalim', 'rodolfooflodor', 'tiffanyynaffit']\n\n\n\nnames_backwards_2 = list()\n\nfor name in names2:\n    names_backwards_2.append(name + name[::-1])\n    \nnames_backwards_2\n\n['TrudeauuaedurT', 'ScheerreehcS', 'SinghhgniS', 'BlanchettehcnalB', 'MayyaM']\n\n\n\nnames_backwards_3 = list()\n\nfor name in names3:\n    names_backwards_3.append(name + name[::-1])\n    \nnames_backwards_3\n\n['appleelppa', 'orangeegnaro', 'bananaananab']\n\n\nAbove: this is very bad also (and imagine if it was 20 lines of code instead of 2). This was problem (2). Our function makes it much better:\n\nmake_palindromes(names1)\n\n['miladdalim', 'rodolfooflodor', 'tiffanyynaffit']\n\n\n\nmake_palindromes(names2)\n\n['TrudeauuaedurT', 'ScheerreehcS', 'SinghhgniS', 'BlanchettehcnalB', 'MayyaM']\n\n\n\nmake_palindromes(names3)\n\n['appleelppa', 'orangeegnaro', 'bananaananab']\n\n\n\nYou could get even more fancy, and put the lists of names into a list (so you have a list of lists).\nThen you could loop over the list and call the function each time:\n\n\nfor list_of_names in [names1, names2, names3]:\n    print(make_palindromes(list_of_names))\n\n['miladdalim', 'rodolfooflodor', 'tiffanyynaffit']\n['TrudeauuaedurT', 'ScheerreehcS', 'SinghhgniS', 'BlanchettehcnalB', 'MayyaM']\n['appleelppa', 'orangeegnaro', 'bananaananab']\n\n\n\n\nDesigning good functions\n\nHow far you go with this is sort of a matter of personal style, and how you choose to apply the DRY principle: DON’T REPEAT YOURSELF!\nThese decisions are often ambiguous. For example:\n\nShould make_palindromes be a function if I’m only ever doing it once? Twice?\nShould the loop be inside the function, or outside?\nOr should there be TWO functions, one that loops over the other??\n\nIn my personal opinion, make_palindromes does a bit too much to be understandable.\nI prefer this:\n\n\ndef make_palindrome(name):\n    return name + name[::-1]\n\nmake_palindrome(\"milad\")\n\n'miladdalim'\n\n\n\nFrom here, we want to “apply make_palindrome to every element of a list”\nIt turns out this is an extremely common desire, so Python has built-in functions.\nOne of these is map, which we’ll cover later. But for now, just a comprehension will do:\n\n\n[make_palindrome(name) for name in names]\n\n['miladdalim',\n 'rodolfooflodor',\n 'tiffanyynaffit',\n 'khaladdalahk',\n 'jeffffej',\n 'christelletsirhc',\n 'firassarif']\n\n\nOther function design considerations:\n\nShould we print output or produce plots inside or outside functions?\n\nI would usually say outside, because this is a “side effect” of sorts\n\nShould the function do one thing or many things?\n\nThis is a tough one, hard to answer in general\n\n\n\n\nOptional & keyword arguments\n\nSometimes it is convenient to have default values for some arguments in a function.\nBecause they have default values, these arguments are optional, hence “optional arguments”\nExample:\n\n\ndef repeat_string(s, n=2):\n    return s*n\n\n\nrepeat_string(\"mds\", 2)\n\n'mdsmds'\n\n\n\nrepeat_string(\"mds\", 5)\n\n'mdsmdsmdsmdsmds'\n\n\nSane defaults:\n\nIdeally, the default should be carefully chosen.\nHere, the idea of “repeating” something makes me think of having 2 copies, so n=2 feels like a sane default.\n\nSyntax:\n\nYou can have any number of arguments and any number of optional arguments\n**All the optional arguments must come after the regular arguments\nThe regular arguments are mapped by the order they appear\nThe optional arguments can be specified out of order\n\n\ndef example(a, b, c=\"DEFAULT\", d=\"DEFAULT\"):\n    print(a,b,c,d)\n    \nexample(1,2,3,4)\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n\nUsing the defaults for c and d:\n\nexample(1,2)\n\n1 2 DEFAULT DEFAULT\n\n\nSpecifying c and d as keyword arguments (i.e. by name):\n\nexample(1,2,c=3,d=4)\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n\nSpecifying only one of the optional arguments, by keyword:\n\nexample(1,2,c=3)\n\n1 2 3 DEFAULT\n\n\nOr the other:\n\nexample(1,2,d=4)\n\n1 2 DEFAULT 4\n\n\nSpecifying all the arguments as keyword arguments, even though only c and d are optional:\n\nexample(a=1,b=2,c=3,d=4)\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n\nSpecifying c by the fact that it comes 3rd (I do not recommend this because I find it is confusing):\n\nexample(1,2,3) \n\n1 2 3 DEFAULT\n\n\nSpecifying the optional arguments by keyword, but in the wrong order (this is also somewhat confusing, but not so terrible - I am OK with it):\n\nexample(1,2,d=4,c=3) \n\n1 2 3 4\n\n\nSpecifying the non-optional arguments by keyword (I am fine with this):\n\nexample(a=1,b=2)\n\n1 2 DEFAULT DEFAULT\n\n\nSpecifying the non-optional arguments by keyword, but in the wrong order (not recommended, I find it confusing):\n\nexample(b=2,a=1)\n\n1 2 DEFAULT DEFAULT\n\n\nSpecifying keyword arguments before non-keyword arguments (this throws an error):\n\nexample(a=2,b=1)\n\n2 1 DEFAULT DEFAULT\n\n\n\nIn general, I am used to calling non-optional arguments by order, and optional arguments by keyword.\nThe language allows us to deviate from this, but it can be unnecessarily confusing sometimes.\n\n\n\nkwargs:\n\nYou can also call/define functions with *args and **kwargs; see, e.g. here\nDo not instantiate objects in the function definition - see here under “Mutable Default Arguments”\n\n\ndef example(a, b=[]): # don't do this!\n    return 0\n\n\ndef example(a, b=None): # insted, do this\n    if b is None:\n        b = []\n    return 0\n\n\n\nAnonymous functions (5 min)\nThere are two ways to define functions in Python:\n\ndef add_one(x):\n    return x+1\n\n\nadd_one(7.2)\n\n8.2\n\n\n\nadd_one = lambda x: x+1 \n\n\ntype(add_one)\n\nfunction\n\n\n\nadd_one(7.2)\n\n8.2\n\n\nThe two approaches above are identical. The one with lambda is called an anonymous function.\nSome differences:\n\nanonymous functions can only take up one line of code, so they aren’t appropriate in most cases.\nanonymous functions evaluate to a function (remember, functions are first-class objects) immediate, so we can do weird stuff with them.\n\n\n(lambda x,y: x+y)(6,7)\n\n13\n\n\n\nevaluate_function_on_x_plus_1(lambda x: x**2, 5)\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[75], line 1\n----&gt; 1 evaluate_function_on_x_plus_1(lambda x: x**2, 5)\n\nNameError: name 'evaluate_function_on_x_plus_1' is not defined\n\n\n\nAbove:\n\nFirst, lambda x: x**2 evaluates to a value of type function\n\nNotice that this function is never given a name - hence “anonymous functions” !\n\nThen, the function and the integer 5 are passed into evaluate_function_on_x_plus_1\nAt which point the anonymous function is evaluated on 5+1, and we get 36."

    "text": "Introduction to the  Terminal (Command Line)\nIf you would like some additional notes and a much deeper explanation of the command line (also known as the Terminal), I suggest the notes from Software Carpentry! They are excellent.\nIn particular, I suggest “Introducing the shell”, “Navigating Files and Directories”, and “Working with Files and Directories”\n\nWhat is the Command Line?\nThe command line is the text interface to the computer that accepts commands that the computer will execute. These commands include:\n\nstarting programs\nnavigating directories and manipulating files\nsearching, sorting, and editing text files\nsystem and environment configuration\n\n\n\nWhy learn command line?\nThe command line is the text interface to the computer. Understanding the command line allows you to interact with the computer in ways that you often cannot with the graphical user interface (GUI).\nThe command line is commonly used for scripting and automation of tasks and when accessing remote systems. It will also be useful to run programs that make use of the command line (eg. github).\n\n\nWhy use command line?\nThe command line is part of the operating system (OS), which is software that manages your computer including all devices and programs.\n\nCommon operating systems include Windows, Mac OS, and Linux/Unix.\nSome commands will be OS specific\n\nYou might be wondering why we would ever prefer command line over using the graphical user interface (GUI). - Certain tools may only be available to command line. - Sometimes command line is faster.\n\n\nCommand Line on Windows\nThe command line on Windows dates back to the original Microsoft operating system called DOS (Disk Operating System) in 1981.\nThis command line interface is still part of all modern Windows operating systems and is accessible as the “Command Prompt”.\nI am requiring you use GitBash instead of the default Windows Command Prompt.\n\n\nWindows Terminal\nThis is what the GitBash “Terminal” looks like. From here on out, whenever we say “Terminal”, we mean “GitBash on Windows”, “Terminal on macOS and Ubuntu”\n\n\nThe directory separator is a forward slash / for Macs/Ubuntu, and the opposite pointing slash on Windows \\\nHowever if you use GitBash, this should preserve your sanity and you should be able to use forward slash on Windows as well\nIn fact, many of the macOS/Ubuntu commands will also work in GitBash, but for completeness we will also share the other commands\n\nImage source: Git for windows\n\n\nMac OS Command Line\nThe command line for Mac OS uses the same commands as Linux. It can be opened using Finder then Utilities then Terminal.\n\nAlternatively, we could type Command-SpaceCommand-Space, then type “Terminal” and press EnterEnter.\n\n\nEntering Commands\nEnter a command at a prompt. The prompt may be a &gt; or a $ or customized by the user.\nPress EnterEnter to execute the command.\nCommands are case-insensitive on both Mac/Linux and Windows. \nHere are some useful Terminal Commands\n\ncd: change directory\npwd: print working directory\nmkdir: make directory\nmkdir -p: make directory and create (p)arent directories if they do not exist\nls: list directory contents\nrm: Delete a file\nrm -r: Delete a directory\ntouch: create an empty file with a specific name\n\n\n\nSpecial Commands\nThese are commands that will require some extra configuration to use. In this workspace, we’ve set them up for you already, but just be warned, these will not be available by default on all machines.\n\ntree: print out a directory tree view of files and folders\ncode: edit the file in the VS Code editor\n\n\n\nLearning Intentions: Terminal\nBy the end of class, and after deliberate practice you should be able to:\n\nDefine command line and list some of its uses\nExplain the purpose of an operating system\nKnow how to open the command line window on macOS and Windows\nEnter commands in the Terminal and stop them\nDefine: file system, folder, file\nExplain the difference between an absolute and relative path\nUse command line shortcuts to save time\nBe able to cancel a command (Ctrl-CCtrl-C)"

It may also be the only way to interact with the machine if connecting via SSH.\nThe command environment allows for redirecting the standard input and output using input/output redirection and pipes.\nYou need to PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE working in the Terminal: to get yourself used to it, I suggest not using the Finder/Explorer on your computer and use the Terminal for everything.\n\nopen will open a file in the default application on macOS.\n\nopen . will open the file in Finder.\nexplorer.exe . will open the folder in Explorer"

You’ll notice that some types are in a class of their own (dict, set, bool) whereas other ones are similar but have distinguishing features (list/tuple/str and int/float etc…).\n\n\nCommon built-in Python data types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish name\nType name\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\ninteger\nint\npositive/negative whole numbers\n42\n\n\nfloating point number\nfloat\nreal number in decimal form\n3.14159\n\n\nboolean\nbool\ntrue or false\nTrue\n\n\nstring\nstr\ntext\n\"I Can Has Cheezburger?\"\n\n\nlist\nlist\na collection of objects - mutable & ordered\n['Ali','Xinyi','Miriam']\n\n\ntuple\ntuple\na collection of objects - immutable & ordered\n('Thursday',6,9,2018)\n\n\ndictionary\ndict\nmapping of key-value pairs\n{'name':'DSCI','code':511,'credits':2}\n\n\nnone\nNoneType\nrepresents no value\nNone\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables and Values\n\nA value is a piece of data that a computer program works with such as a number or text.\nThere are different types of values: 42 is an integer and \"Hello!\" is a string.\nA variable is a name that refers to a value.\n\nIn mathematics and statistics, we usually use variables names like \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\nIn Python, we can use any word as a variable name (as long as it starts with a letter and is not a reserved word in Python such as for, while, class, lambda, etc.).\n\nAnd we use the assignment operator = to assign a value to a variable.\nSee the Python 3 documentation for a summary of the standard built-in Python datatypes.\nSee Think Python (Chapter 2) for a discussion of variables, expressions and statements in Python.\n\n\n\nNumeric Types\n\nx = 42.5\n\n\ntype(x)\n\nfloat\n\n\n\nx = 5\nprint(x)\n\n5\n\n\n\nx=5\nx-2\n\n3\n\n\n\npi = 3.14159\n\n\nprint(pi)\n\n3.14159\n\n\n\ntype(pi)\n\nfloat\n\n\n\nArithmetic Operators\nThe syntax for the arithmetic operators are:\n\n\n\nOperator\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n+\naddition\n\n\n-\nsubtraction\n\n\n*\nmultiplication\n\n\n/\ndivision\n\n\n**\nexponentiation\n\n\n//\ninteger division\n\n\n%\nmodulo\n\n\n\nLet’s apply these operators to numeric types and observe the results.\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5\n\n15\n\n\n\n0.1 + 0.2\n\n0.30000000000000004\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFrom Firas: This is floating point arithmetic.

Items cannot be replaced or changed, but can be removed or added.\ntuple: items are ordered, but cannot be replaced or changed once created.\n\n\nmylist = ['one','two','apples','three','apples',600.50, 50, 'banana']\n\n\nset(mylist)\n\n{50, 600.5, 'apples', 'banana', 'one', 'three', 'two'}\n\n\n\nmytuple = ('one','two','apples', 600.5)\n\nmytuple\n\n('one', 'two', 'apples', 600.5)\n\n\n\nmytuple +('blagreenck',)\n\n('one', 'two', 'apples', 600.5, 'blagreenck')\n\n\n\nSets\n\nAnother built-in Python data type is the set, which stores an un-ordered list of unique items.\n\n\ns = {2,3,5,11}\ns\n\n{2, 3, 5, 11}\n\n\n\n{1,2,3} == {3,2,1}\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n[1,2,3] == [3,2,1]\n\nFalse\n\n\n\ns.add(2) # does nothing\ns\n\n{2, 3, 5, 11}\n\n\n\ns[0]\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[39], line 1\n----&gt; 1 s[0]\n\nTypeError: 'set' object is not subscriptable\n\n\n\nAbove: throws an error because elements are not ordered.\n\n\n\nBoolean\n\nThe Boolean (bool) type has two values: True and False.\n\n\nthe_truth = True\n\n\nprint(the_truth)\n\nTrue\n\n\n\ntype(the_truth)\n\nbool\n\n\n\nlies = False\n\n\nprint(lies)\n\nFalse\n\n\n\ntype(lies)\n\nbool\n\n\n\nComparison Operators\nCompare objects using comparison operators.
